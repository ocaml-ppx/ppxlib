{0 Ppxlib's user manual}

{1 Overview}

This is the user manual and api for ppxlib, the core of the ppx meta-programming
system for {{:https://ocaml.org/}OCaml} and its derivatives such as
{{:https://reasonml.github.io/}Reason}. This manual is aimed at both users and
authors of ppx rewriters and contains everything one should know in order to use
or write ppx rewriters.

It is assumed in this manual that the user is familiar with the
{{:https://dune.build/}Dune} build system. In particular, all the examples in
this manual referring to the build system will present
{{:https://dune.build/}Dune} configurations files and commands. It is possible
to use ppxlib with other build systems, however this is not covered by this
manual.
