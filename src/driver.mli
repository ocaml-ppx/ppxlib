(** [register_transformation name] registers a code transformation.

    [name] is a logical name for the transformation (such as [sexp_conv] or
    [bin_prot]). It is mostly used for debugging purposes.

    [rules] is a list of context independent rewriting rules, such as extension point
    expanders. This is what most code transformation should use. Rules from all registered
    transformations are all applied at the same time, before any other
    transformations. Moreover they are applied in a top-down manner, giving more control
    to extensions on how they interpret their payload.

    For instance:

    - some extensions capture a pretty-print of the payload in their expansion and using
      top-down ensures that the payload is as close as possible to the original code
    - some extensions process other extension in a special way inside their payload. For
      instance [%here] (from ppx_here) will normally expand to a record of type
      [Lexing.position]. However when used inside [%sexp] (from ppx_sexp_value) it will
      expand to the human-readable sexp representation of a source code position.

    [extensions] is a special cases of [rules] and is deprecated. It is only kept for
    backward compatibility.

    [enclose_impl] and [enclose_intf] produces a header and footer for
    implementation/interface files. They are a special case of [impl] and [intf]. Both
    functions receive a location that denotes the whole file, or [None] if the file
    contains nothing.

    [impl] is an optional function that is applied on implementation files and [intf] is
    an optional function that is applied on interface files. These two functions are
    applied on the AST of the whole file. They should only be used when the other
    mechanism are not enough. For instance if the transformation expands extension points
    that depend on the context.

    If no rewriter is using [impl] and [intf], then the whole transformation is completely
    independent of the order in which the various rewriter are specified. Moreover the
    resulting driver will be faster as it will do only one pass (excluding safety checks)
    on the whole AST.

    [lint_impl] and [lint_intf] are applied to the unprocessed source. Errors they return
    will be reported to the user as preprocessor warnings.

    Rewritings are applied in the following order:
    - linters ([lint_impl], [lint_intf])
    - preprocessing ([preprocess_impl], [preprocess_intf])
    - contest-independent rules ([rules], [extensions])
    - whole-file transformations ([impl], [intf], [enclose_impl], [enclose_intf])

(** Rewriters might call this function to suggest a correction to the code source. When

    A file property represent a piece of information about a file that can be set during

    driver, then it will output this information to the given file.

    This mechanism is used to pass information gathered while preprocessing the file to
    the build system. For instance, this is used by ppx_inline_test to tell whether a file
    contains tests or not.

    In the future we could also use this to directly compute the dependencies and pass
    them here, to avoid calling ocamldep separately.
