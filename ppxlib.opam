synopsis: "Standard infrastructure for ppx rewriters"
description: """
Ppxlib is the standard infrastructure for ppx rewriters
and other programs that manipulate the in-memory representation of
OCaml programs, a.k.a the "Parsetree".

It also comes bundled with two ppx rewriters that are commonly used to
write tools that manipulate and/or generate Parsetree values;
`ppxlib.metaquot` which allows to construct Parsetree values using the
OCaml syntax directly and `ppxlib.traverse` which provides various
ways of automatically traversing values of a given type, in particular
allowing to inject a complex structured value into generated code.
